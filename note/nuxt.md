# Composables

Nuxt has many built-in composables helping SEO, SSR etc.

## `useHead` and `useHeadSafe`

They are part of [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/), a JS library initially built for Vue and Nuxt to control things outside the app entry.

[`useHeadSafe`](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-head-safe) can prevent potential code injection like setting innerHTML.
